# Advanced Machine Learning Project - Q-learning using Gymnasium (Open AI Gym)

>**Abstract:**<br>
The goal of this project is to develop a reinforcement learning algorithm to train a deep learning model capable of playing a video game of our choice, using only the game's pixel data as input. To achieve this, we used the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html) Python module, which provides an interface to create and test various games. In this work, we will explore three games. First, we worked with the game Lunar Lander to familiarize ourselves with Gymnasium and train an agent using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that takes all the environment's information (states, actions, etc.) as inputs. Then, we transitioned to the Frozen Lake game to train an agent with a simpler game using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that takes image as inputs. Finally, we tested our approach on a more complex game, Pong from Atari games.

## Environnement setup
Install the required packages by running the first section of the notebook or run this command in a terminal:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the code
Before proceeding with the rest of the notebook, please ensure you run all the cells in sections 1 and 2 first. These sections contain essential setup and initialization code that is required for the subsequent parts of the notebook to function correctly.
